# Task ID: 5
# Title: Setup Model Version Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a system for managing AI model versions and weights.
# Details:
Create a model registry that tracks model versions, metadata, and performance metrics. Implement a system to load models from configurable storage locations. Support automatic detection of GPU/CPU environments and optimize model loading accordingly. Implement caching for frequently used models.

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
import torch

class ModelType(Enum):
    FACE_RECOGNITION = "face_recognition"
    DISEASE_DETECTION = "disease_detection"
    BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS = "behavior_analysis"
    # Add other model types

class ModelRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        self.model_configs: Dict[str, Dict] = {}
        self.device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    
    def register_model(self, model_type: ModelType, version: str, model_path: str, metadata: Optional[Dict] = None):
        # Register model configuration
        pass
        
    def load_model(self, model_type: ModelType, version: Optional[str] = None):
        # Load model from storage and cache it
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
Test model loading with different versions. Verify GPU/CPU detection works correctly. Test model caching performance. Ensure models can be correctly versioned and tracked.
