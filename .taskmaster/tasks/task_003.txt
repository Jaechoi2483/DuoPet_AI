# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Logging and Monitoring System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a structured logging system and performance monitoring for the API services.
# Details:
Use Python's logging module with a structured JSON formatter. Implement middleware to log request/response details and performance metrics. Setup monitoring for API usage, response times, and error rates. Configure log rotation and different log levels based on environment.

```python
import logging
import json
from fastapi import Request, Response
import time

class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def format(self, record):
        log_record = {
            'timestamp': self.formatTime(record),
            'level': record.levelname,
            'message': record.getMessage(),
            'module': record.module
        }
        if hasattr(record, 'request_id'):
            log_record['request_id'] = record.request_id
        return json.dumps(log_record)

async def logging_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    response.headers['X-Process-Time'] = str(process_time)
    logging.info(f"Processed request in {process_time:.4f} seconds")
    return response
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify logs are correctly formatted and contain all required fields. Test that performance metrics are accurately recorded. Ensure log levels work correctly in different environments.
